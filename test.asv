    "How times can change. A few months ago, North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un, was firing missiles over Japan and threatening to send nuclear bombs in our direction. Now North Korea has agreed to open its doors to food, medicine and the message of Christ.But last week, the young North Korea leader dropped a different kind of surprise on the world: He met with South Korean president Moon Jae-in on April 27 and announced that the 67-year-old Korean conflict is over.  I came here to put an end to the history of confrontation, Kim Jung-un told Moon in a meeting on the border town of Panmunjom.There will be no more war on the Korean peninsula, and a new age of peace has begun,  the two leaders said in a joint statement.Charisma Magazine reports: Kim Jong-un, who has built the fourth largest army in the world—with 1.19 million soldiers—says he will now focus on rebuilding his country’s shattered economy.Boom. Just like that, swords were converted into plowshares. The two leaders, all smiles for the cameras, agreed they will denuclearize the Korean peninsula within a year. They also agreed to set up reunions with families that have been divided since the Korean War started in 1950.It feels like we should declare a global holiday and dance in the streets. But most Americans were too distracted by the opening of the new Avengers movie to pay attention to the headlines.What was behind the Korean surprise? Most media outlets didn’t notice that Christians in South Korea had been fasting and praying for the peace summit. Pastors held an all-night vigil in the city of Paju, south of the North Korean border. And a group of Christian politicians held a fasting and prayer event in the National Assembly buildings in Seoul, according to Yonhap News.North Korea’s persecuted Christians have also been praying for this moment—for years. They have been horribly persecuted. They have been forced to meet secretly. They have been routinely rounded up and sent to labor camps—or just shot on sight—because they did not worship Kim Jong-un as their god."
    "The former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.Convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius was, according to reports, rushed to a local state hospital in the early hours of Saturday after he allegedly attempted on his life.Although information is still sketchy, a social media report claimed that the former Paralympic athlete had injured his wrists in his prison cell.He was rushed to a nearby hospital.According to City Press, correctional services said Pistorius claimed he had injured himself after falling out of bed.An inmate situated close to the hospital section told City Press that Pistorius had injured himself intentionally, the news report stated.The report added that sharp blades were subsequently found in Pistorius’ cell during a search on Saturday afternoon.The reports could not yet be confirmed.Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent. A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found toxic pills inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others."
    "President Trump voted in favor of the death penalty for being gayPresident Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn't sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a 'discriminatory manner,' particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia."
    "Target CEO Brian Cornell announced today the retail giant will be discontinuing sales of the Holy Bible. The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902.Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls religious extremists as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. Target will no longer cater to religious extremists, said Cornell. If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it. Cornell said the big box chain is sticking to its guns regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion. We believe that everyone, every team member, every guest, and every community, deserves to be treated equally, regardless of their religious beliefs."
    "Nick Ayers, the chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, will not succeed President Donald Trump's current chief of staff John Kelly, Ayers confirmed in a tweet Sunday. He had been considered the front-runner to the role after the president announced Saturday that Kelly would leave the position by year's end.Thank you @realDonaldTrump, @VP, and my great colleagues for the honor to serve our Nation at The White House, Ayers said in a tweet Sunday afternoon after multiple outlets reported he won't be the next White House chief of staff. I will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause.The Wall Street Journal was the first outlet to report that Ayers would not be Trump's next chief of staff.Citing White House officials, The Journal reported that Ayers, 36, told Trump he couldn't commit to spending more than the first three months of next year in the job. Trump ultimately decided he wanted his next chief of staff to serve for a longer time frame, the outlet reported.Trump said Saturday that he will name Kelly's replacement soon. On Sunday night, the president tweeted that he was in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position."
    "There were ten times more air strikes in the covert war on terror during President Barack Obama’s presidency than under his predecessor, George W. Bush.Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama’s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau.The use of drones aligned with Obama’s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism.The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so “exceptionally surgical and precise” that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting “innocent men, women and children in danger”. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau’s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case.The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US’s estimate of the number of civilians killed – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher.That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan – where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1,337 weapons dropped last year alone – a 40% rise on 2015.Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations (UN) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama’s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush’s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.563Strikes in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama’s two terms57Strikes in those countries under George W. BushStrikes in the country peaked in 2010, with 128 CIA drone attacks and at least 89 civilians killed, at the same time US troop numbers surged in Afghanistan. Pakistan strikes have since fallen with just three conducted in the country last year.Obama also began an air campaign targeting Yemen. His first strike was a catastrophe: commanders thought they were targeting al Qaeda but instead hit a tribe with cluster munitions, killing 55 people. Twenty-one were children – 10 of them under five. Twelve were women, five of them pregnant.Through 2010 and the first half of 2011 US strikes in Yemen continued sporadically. The air campaign then began in earnest, with the US using its drones and jets to help Yemeni ground forces oust al Qaeda forces who had taken advantage of the country’s Arab Spring to seize a swath of territory in the south of the country.In Somalia, US Special Operations Forces and gunships had been fighting al Qaeda and its al Shabaab allies since January 2007. The US sent drones to Djibouti in 2010 to support American operations in Yemen, but did not start striking in Somalia until 2011.The number of civilian casualties increased alongside the rise in strikes. However reported civilian casualties began to fall as Obama’s first term progressed, both in real terms and as a rate of civilians reported killed per strike.In Yemen, where there has been a minimum of 65 civilian deaths since 2002, the Bureau recorded no instances of civilian casualties last year. There were three non-combatants reportedly killed in 2016 in Somalia, where the US Air Force has been given broader authority to target al Shabaab – in previous years there were no confirmed civilian deaths.Strikes in Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia have always been dwarfed by the frequency of air attacks on battlefields such as Afghanistan.December 2014 saw the end of Nato combat operations there, and the frequency of air attacks plummeted in 2015. Strikes are now increasing again, with a 40% rise in 2016, though numbers remain below the 2011 peak.The number of countries being simultaneously bombed by the US increased to seven last year as a new front opened up in the fight against Islamic State (IS). The US has been leading a coalition of countries in the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria since August 2014, conducting a total of 13,501 strikes across both countries, according to monitoring group Airwars.In August US warplanes started hitting the group hard in Libya. The US declared 495 strikes in the country between August 1 and December 5 as part of efforts to stop IS gaining more ground, Airwars data shows."
    "Hillary Clinton has won the popular vote by more than 2.86 million ballots, the final tally in the US presidential election has revealed.According to the Cook Political Report, the Democrat beat the President-elect by 2,864,974 - more than five times the margin garnered by Al Gore in 2000 when he also lost the Electoral College.The final count comes after 304 electors voted for Donald Trump on Monday, meaning that although two electors defected, he cleared the 270-vote hurdle and will be sworn in as president next month.Mr Trump's win ranks 46th out of 58 on the list of Electoral College votes secured by US Presidents since George Washington in 1789. His popular vote tally was more than two percentage points lower than Ms Clinton's, at 46.1 per cent against her 48.2 per cent – or 62.98 million against 65.84 million.Ms Clinton's tally was just under 72,000 votes shy of Barack Obama's popular vote count in the 2012 election.Mr Trump won 30 states in the 8 November election, securing 306 of the 538 Electoral College votes – 56.9 per cent of the total.Only 12 other elections have seen a president receive a lower proportion of Electoral College votes, including George W Bush in 2000 and 2004, and John F Kennedy in 1960.Confirmation of Mr Trump's victory ended an acrimonious final chapter in an election cycle that saw former president Bill Clinton accuse the director of the FBI, James Comey, of costing his wife the White House, and activists flood the letterboxes of Electoral College members with pleas to abandon the Republican candidate.Despite the pressure on electors, experts had said a Trump defeat in the Electoral College was extremely unlikely.Dr Jacob Parakilas, assistant head of the US and Americas Programme at Chatham House, told The Independent: A lot of this is just a reaction to how outlandish the whole election season has been.President Obama suggests Hillary Clinton didn't work as hard on campaign trail as he didI think there's also a sense that because Trump won with a significant gap between the Electoral College and the popular vote, that underscores calls for the Electoral College to do something different than it normally does.By and large, those calls are going to fall on deaf ears."];
